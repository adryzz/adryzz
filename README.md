Hi! I'm Lena. (she/her) 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

If you were looking for some kind of resource or "about" page, then this is probably it.

I love programming, music, drawing, trains, emotional anime, chemistry, physics, math... (the list is quite long)

My favorite programming languages (and thus the ones I'm most comfortable with) are Rust and C#, but i can work with just about anything after a bit of practice.

I mainly focus on desktop, web backend, driver and embedded development, but i have worked on web apps, ML...
